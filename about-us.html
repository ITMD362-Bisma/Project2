      <h2>ISUD Mission Statement</h2>
      <p class="mission-statement">
        The International Society for Universal Dialogue (ISUD) was founded in Warsaw, Poland
        in 1989. By means of scholarly work, ISUD aims for the gradual realization of a decent,
        peaceful, and just world order. This includes:
      </p>
      <ol id="list-fundamentals" class="list-objectives">
        <li>World peace.</li>
        <li>Human rights.</li>
        <li>Preservation of the world ecology.</li>
        <li>Dialogical interrelations of diverse cultures.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="mission-statement">
        Towards these goals, ISUD produces biannual international conferences to facilitate an
        ethos of universal dialogue. ISUD is a member of the International Federation of
        Philosophical Societies (FISP). FISP is a multidisciplinary international association
        of philosophers and scholars devoted to promoting the discussion of fundamental issues:
      </p>
      <ol id="list-questions" class="list-objectives">
        <li>What role does philosophical thinking have in moving towards a more rational and more humane future?</li>
        <li>What are ethical principles of dialogue?</li>
        <li>How may one understand cultural diversity and universality?</li>
        <li>How best to work toward a culture of peace?</li>
        <li>What is the relationship between the basic liberties of individuals and the collective rights of cultural groups?</li>
      </ol>

    <section class="section-about-us" id="section-constitution">
      <h2>The ISUD Constitution</h2>
      <ul id="container-constitution">
        <li>
          <p>
            We the Members of the International Society for Universal Dialogue, in order to investigate and articulate
            the basic principles of universality systematically, rationally, and comprehensively&mdash;working to promote a
            world&#8209;wide understanding of these principles, striving to help generate universal world&#8209;consciousness
            towards the gradual emergence of a decent world order, and aspiring to actualize the highest and richest
            human values in art, science, politics, education, and social life&mdash;do agree to declare the following
            statement as the constitution of the International Society for Universal Dialogue.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Article I</h3>
          <p>
            The official name of the society shall be &ldquo;The International Society for Universal Dialogue&rdquo; to be
            incorporated in the state of Maine, USA.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Article II</h3>
          <p>
            Scholars, especially philosophers, from all the countries of the world without exception, are entitled to
            membership in the Society without any discrimination based on sex, race, color, nationality, religion,
            sexual preference, or social class. The democratic way of thinking and acting shall be the guiding principle
            of all decisions which determine the plans and projects of the society.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Article III</h3>
          <p>
            The ISUD acknowledges that it was the idea of Universalism that gathered the Society together in Warsaw in
            November, 1989; and further acknowledges and honors its close relationship with the publication Dialogue
            and Universalism which provides a forum in which all members of ISUD have the opportunity to communicate
            and exchange their views.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Article IV</h3>
          <p>1.</p>
          <p>
            The main purpose of the Society is to promote, in theory and in practice, the ideals of universality as the
            most effective means for the gradual realization of a decent, peaceful, and just world order. To achieve this
            purpose, the members of ISUD shall try—by means of scholarly work, regional and international conferences, as
            well as personal and collective work —to explore and share important areas of human knowledge and experience.
          </p>
          <p>2.</p>
          <p>
            More specifically, the purpose of the Society is to evoke and invigorate a global consciousness; that is, the
            existential awareness that all the peoples of the world belong to one species, the human species, and accordingly
            have the same fundamental stock of needs, aspirations, and capacities. This involves the recognition that these
            needs, aspirations, and capacities cannot be adequately realized under conditions of selfish competition,
            violence, and exploitation but under conditions of peace, cooperation, and freedom. It also involves recognition
            of the responsibility to other species, and to the preservation and restoration of the health and beauty of all
            eco-systems on the planet.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Article V</h3>
          <p>1.</p>
          <p>
            The Society shall be administered by a body of governors called the Board of the International Society of
            Universal Dialogue (ISUD); and it shall operate in concert with this Constitution, and with the decisions made
            by the ISUD General Assembly that meets prior to the tenure of a new Board.
          </p>
          <p>2.</p>
          <p>
            The Board includes an executive committee composed of four officers: Chair, Vice Chair, Secretary, and Treasurer;
            and it also includes a body of other members that number no fewer than six and no more than twelve. (So the full
            Board shall be no fewer than ten and no more than sixteen, including officers.) Board members are elected for one
            cycle (normally two years) to serve in a particular Board position, and have the possibility of being re-elected
            to one additional term in the same position. However, there must be at least one intervening cycle for a Board
            member to be reelected another time for the same position.
          </p>
          <p>
            (In some circumstances these term restrictions may be waived by vote of the General Assembly so as to sustain
            regional representation and support the growth of the Society.) 
          </p>
          <p>3.</p>
          <p>
            All members of the Board shall be elected at the General Assembly by a majority vote. Only those who are actually
            present at the General Assembly are eligible for election.
          </p>
          <p>4.</p>
          <p>
            The General Assembly is composed of those members of the ISUD who personally attend the periodic world conferences
            held by the Society—usually every two years. The General Assembly meets in sessions that coincide with the periodic
            world conferences. 
          </p>
          <p>5.</p>
          <p>
            Decisions by the General Assembly shall be reached by a majority vote, except for amendments of the Constitution,
            for which a two-thirds majority is required. The competence of the General Assembly includes all questions relating
            to the activity of the Society that are put before it in the usual manner.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Article VI</h3>
          <p>1.</p>
          <p>
            The Chair, Vice Chair, Secretary, and Treasurer shall be voting members of the Board. In the event of a deadlock
            (tie vote) with respect to some matter in the Executive Committee, the matter shall be referred to the full Board
            for discussion and decision.
          </p>
          <p>2.</p>
          <p>
            The Chair and Vice Chair of the Society have the responsibility of administrating all the decisions and actions of
            the Society, and of doing so in consultation with other members of the Executive Committee, in ongoing consultation
            with the full Board, and in keeping with the decisions of the General Assembly. They shall, moreover, oversee all
            the Society&#8217;s activities and present a report to the Society at each general meeting. They, as well as every
            member of the Society, are entitled to make any recommendation that may serve the interest of universality.
          </p>
          <p>3.</p>
          <p>
            The Chair and Vice Chair of the Society are the main administrative officers of all the organs, or chapters, of the
            Society; they are also ex officio voting members of all the committees of the Society. They have the authority to
            delegate tasks which are essential to the work and progress of the Society, and to authorize the expenditures of the
            Society within the scope of the budget. They supervise the preparation of the ISUD World Congress, preside over it
            during the whole of its duration, and chair the sessions of the General Assembly.
          </p>
          <p>4.</p>
          <p>
            The Chair and Vice Chair shall do their best to further the immediate and long term objectives of the Society in their
            regions and shall stay in touch with the Board concerning all matters which affect the cause of universality. They
            should also work with the Site Coordinator concerning the organization and management of the next World Congress.
          </p>
          <p>5.</p>
          <p>
            The Secretary is responsible for taking careful minutes of all Executive Committee meetings, all Board meetings
            whenever they occur, and General Assembly meetings. Such minutes should be shared with the Board in a timely manner
            for discussion and approval.
          </p>
          <p>6.</p>
          <p>
            The Secretary has the responsibility for relaying all the news which matters to the Society. The Secretary also has
            responsibility to maintain an accurate membership list and to manage communications. Any questions or proposals which
            the society members might have should normally be addressed to the Secretary.
          </p>
          <p>7.</p>
          <p>
            The Treasurer shall be considered the custodian of the treasury of the International Society for Universal Dialogue
            and must keep accurate records of all the financial transactions of the Society in compliance with its tax exempt
            status under Section 501 (c 3) of the Internal Revenue Code, and shall file the required forms with the Internal
            Revenue Service in the USA.  Moreover, he/she shall make special efforts to contact Foundations and Organizations,
            which are sympathetic with the goals of universality, in order to support and lend financial assistance to the regional
            and international meetings.
          </p>
          <p>8.</p>
          <p>
            The Treasurer, or any officer authorized by the Chair, shall sign checks and authorize disbursements on behalf of the
            Society and complete the financial transactions of the Society.  A record of the authorization and/or instructions from
            the Chair for this purpose must be retained.  When prior approval is not possible, amounts over $500 must be reported to
            the Chair immediately.
          </p>
          <p>9.</p>
          <p>
            The Treasurer must keep exact records of all expenditures, and must present a report of all the credits and debits of the
            accounts of the Society at each international meeting; and must, between international meetings, also maintain a
            transparent budget with respect to the Board. To this end, the Treasurer must maintain copies of all credits, receipts,
            invoices, paid out checks, bank statements (etc.), all of which must upon request be made available to an Auditing Committee.
          </p>
          <p>10.</p>
          <p>
            An Auditing Committee of at least two ISUD members will be chosen by the ISUD Board. The Auditing Committee will carry out an
            audit once a year by the end of each September; and this Committee will be given access to any and all ISUD financial documents
            they request. The results of such audits will be shared with all current Board members.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Article VII</h3>
          <p>1.</p>
          <p>
            The Board, under the guidance of the Chair, shall be responsible for arranging the agenda of the international meetings of
            the Society and shall do all it can to promote the purposes of the Society and keep its momentum alive and dynamic. It shall
            also advise the Chair on all matters relating to the operation and growth of the Society; and for this purpose the Board
            must be kept informed by the Executive Committee.
          </p>
          <p>2.</p>
          <p>
            The position of Site Coordinator will be appointed by the Chair in consultation with the Executive Committee.
          </p>
          <p>3.</p>
          <p>
            Working with the Executive Committee and in close cooperation with the Chair, the Site Coordinator will be responsible for
            taking a lead role in the organization and management of the new World Congress.
          </p>
          <p>4.</p>
          <p>
            If vacancy occurs in the list of officers on the Executive Committee, the Chair, with the informed consent and advice of the
            Board, can temporarily fill the vacancy with another ISUD member. But if the Chair is, for some reason, unable or unwilling
            to fulfill this function, the Board shall have the authority to fill this vacancy and shall do so by majority vote.
          </p>
          <p>5.</p>
          <p>
            The Board shall, in consultation with the Secretary, authorize cooperative programs or activities with other organizations.
          </p>
          <p>6.</p>
          <p>
            Membership in the Society requires the payment of dues.  Membership dues can be paid during the biannual international
            meetings of the Society or sent to the Treasurer.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Article VIII</h3>
          <p>1.</p>
          <p>
            The election of all the officers and Board members of the Society by the General Assembly shall be done by a majority vote
            of the ISUD members present.
          </p>
          <p>2.</p>
          <p>
            New members of the Board and the Executive Committee shall be nominated by the Board.  The Board will normally nominate one
            or two candidates for the Executive Committee positions. Nominees will also be accepted from the floor at the General Assembly.
          </p>
          <p>3.</p>
          <p>
            The names of the new members shall be published in the official membership list and posted on the ISUD website, for the
            information of all interested parties.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Article IX</h3>
          <p>
            To protect the Society in future years a procedure for evaluation and removal from office after due dialogue is outlined in
            this Constitution. If any member of the ISUD Board should persistently violate this Constitution in any significant way, or
            act in a way that seriously jeopardizes our Society, that member will be subject to a process of potential removal. In such
            a case, the full Board (except the member facing removal) will fully discuss via e-mail (or in person if possible) all the
            various reasons a given member might face removal. All such correspondence must be shared with the full Board, except the
            member facing possible removal. Within two weeks of the initiation of such discussions, the member facing possible removal
            must be fully informed of the reasons for possible removal, and be asked to make a response if desired within one week. Any
            such response must be shared with all others on the Board, and discussed by them. Then within another week, a vote should be
            taken concerning removal of the member. A two-thirds majority of the full Board (less the member facing removal) is necessary
            for removal from office.
